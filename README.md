# Hi, I'm Indira Franchi

My passion for technology is a fundamental part of who I am and as a result, I graduated as a Telecommunications Engineer. During my career I faced great challenges that helped me to acquire research and problem solving skills.

I consider myself very inquisitive, I like to learn new things; which has driven me to be a self-taught person. I have knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. I have also been introduced to the world of cybersecurity.

Theory is fundamental but practice makes perfect, so in this profile you will be able to see projects/challenges that have helped me to train myself.
